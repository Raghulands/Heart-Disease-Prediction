Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. 
It demonstrates a complete workflow including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.


Overview
Heart disease is a major global health concern. Early detection helps in preventive care and improved outcomes. 
This project builds a predictive classification model using medical features to determine whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

The project includes:
- Dataset analysis
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models
- Performance evaluation
- Final prediction pipeline

Machine Learning Models
The notebook explores and evaluates various algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Decision Tree  
- K Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine  

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  


How to Run

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Raghulands/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git

2. Install required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook Heartpredit.ipynb


Results

Model performance comparisons are shown in the notebook.
The most accurate and balanced model is selected for final predictions.

If you want a version with shields/badges, project structure, or images/graphs, I can add that too.
